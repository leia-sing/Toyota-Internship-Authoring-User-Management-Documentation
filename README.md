# Toyota Internship Project: Authoring User Management Documentation

**Here is my project contribution in a nutshell:**

- During my co-op at Toyota, a enterprise-wide software named Privacy+ was implemented at Toyota Motor North America (TMNA) to streamline privacy assessments and documentation.
- I identified that the system initially **lacked a critical capability** to differentiate between two key user roles, posing a risk to system usability.
- By proactively **documenting** and **communicating** this issue, I facilitated a vendor-provided solution before the go-live date, ensuring smooth system functionality for the go-live, **impacting over 90,000 team member users**. The User Management document I authored continues to serve as a critical resource for ongoing system maintenance for the Privacy team.

## Approach

1. **Understanding the situation** – In a working session, I learned that the project manager had plans to create a User Management document. Seeing an opportunity to contribute to the team's needs and to increase my own learning and skills, I offered to take the lead on the document. To grasp user management of this software, I conducted interviews with internal teams and the vendor to understand system capabilities.
2. **Realizing the issue gap** – While drafting the document, I discovered a significant issue: the platform did not support role differentiation in a way that met Toyota’s business needs. This gap would have hindered the ability of two key user groups to perform their required tasks post-launch. To delineate the exact limitations, I mapped Toyota’s role-based access needs against the vendor software functionalities and identified a gap between the two.
3. **Becoming the bridge** – I presented the document capturing Toyota's need for user management capabilities to the vendor, explained the gap we were facing, detailed Toyota's requirements to close that gap, and the consequences of usability problems if the issue wasn’t solved. After I presented it, the vendor came back with a solution which solved our user role problem.

The result of solving the user role issue that the tool offered smooth user experience for the **60+ team members** who used the platform in training, and eventually the **90,000+ team members** enterprise-wide who will access the platform. 

In the bigger picture, my ability to identify and communicate this user role problem was important to achieve an increased adoption rate for overall users of the platform (than otherwise), which served our team’s goal of increasing our documentation of privacy practices and, therefore, ultimately served our goal of compliance. 

## Documentation Sample
While I can't show the full document I created to protect the confidentiality of Toyota's internal processes, this anonymized table is a sample that shows how I illustrated the differentiated user capabilities by TMNA business role and software role. 

In the right two columns, you can see there are different capabilities granted to different access profiles - these access profiles in the two right-most columns would be used by the potential 90,000 members across TMNA, so it was imperative that these two profiles were provisioned and granted the correct capabilities in time for go-live.

## Learnings

- I learned how to tackle problems more effectively—talking to team members, breaking down the issue, prioritizing what mattered most, setting clear criteria, and setting realistic goals.  
- I improved on making documentation clear and useful by defining key criteria and writing in a way that made sense to everyone, not just those deep in the details.  
- I gained valuable experience in stakeholder management, balancing the needs of the privacy team with what the vendor could deliver and keeping communication clear and smooth.
